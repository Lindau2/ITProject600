  <div class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      We are third-year Information Technology students building <strong>Smart Energy Meter</strong>, a mobile and web-based application that helps South African households track, manage, and reduce electricity usage.
      The system supports both prepaid and postpaid meters, offering real-time insights into consumption and cost, while also addressing challenges like load shedding and unpredictable tariffs.
